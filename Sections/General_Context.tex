\section{General context}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Opponent modelling roughly aims to compute a model of other agents in order to optimize action selection.
    \item While a well developed field, methods have yet to extend to open environments. 
    \item For an open environment, methods need to be swift, scalable and robust. 
    \item This document looks at the swift component --- in short, RL agents are swift to execute, however take a while to train and can be unpredictable when dynamics shift drastically from training. Model-based reasoning approaches (planning) tends to be safer and predictable, but slow to execute. 
    \item This document briefly discusses the state of the art in combining search and learning, and identifies gaps in the literature.
