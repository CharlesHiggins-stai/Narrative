\input{Sections/Environments.tex}
\subsection{Experiments}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Baseline --- plastic policy
    \item Baseline --- Monte Carlo Agent
    \item Baseline --- Monte Carlo Particle Filter
    \item Show average performance against randomly selected opponents over 10000 rounds. 
    \item Show 
    \item Monte Carlo Policy --- show robustness to reduced sample/rollout size. 
    \item Show robustness compared to learning agent (in terms of learning)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Evaluation/Thoughts}
\section{Future work \& Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Monte Carlo --- supervised learning for quick learning and policy generation (Similar to monte-carlo A3C supervision...)
    \item Value theoretic function --- learn more about opponents to better classify faster
    \item Strategy Generation --- Monte Carlo agent for strategy imposing... 
\end{itemize}
